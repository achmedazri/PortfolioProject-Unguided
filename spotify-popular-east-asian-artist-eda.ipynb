I decided to focus more on Top Artist dataset to find some insights.\nThis project was completed by Achmed Azri on 20230906.\n\nThis dataset consists of two parts which are the top artists and top tracks from 7 different 'query genres' from Spotify API namely chinese, japanese, korean, k-pop, j-pop, j-idol and j-dance.\n\n\n#### Note:\n\n1. Datasets related to top artists are sorted by number of followers on Spotify\n2. Datasets related to top tracks are sorted by the popularity metric on Spotify\n3. Data is extracted using Spotify API, feel free to use the datasets as long as it cope with their term of use\n4. Some tracks/artists may be duplicated due to them being on two or more query genres\n5. Inspirations of using the datasets include a EDA analysis on the top tracks and artists, finding sleeper hits/trending music, or just to explore some new taste and music!\n\n\n#### Features in top artist datasets\n\n1. artist_name: name of the artist\n2. popularity: a popularity metric calculated by Spotify, ranging from 0-100 with 100 being the most popular\n3. followers: number of followers of the artist on Spotify\n4. artist_link: external link to artist page on Spotify\n5. genres: list of genres that the artist is involved in\n6. top_track: top track of the artist based on Spotify API\n7. top_track_album: the album that the top track is in\n8. top_track_popularity: the popularity of top track; a popularity metric calculated by Spotify, ranging from 0-100 with 100 being the most popular\n9. top_track_release_date: release date of the top track\n10. top_track_duration_ms: the duration of the top track in milliseconds\n11. top_track_explicit: boolean value that indicated if the top track is explicit or not\n12. top_track_link: external link to the top track on Spotify\n13. top_track_album_link: external link to the album of the top track on Spotify\n14. query_genre: query_genre of the artist\n\n\n\n#### Problem Statement;\n\n>* Which column that is unnecessary for our analysis?\n>* How many unique artist_name in top 50 Songs?\n>* How many explicit track listed in top 50 Songs?\n>* Identifying most genre in top 50 Songs.\n>* Relationship between song release date and top track popularity.\n>* Relationship between song duration and top track popularity.\n>* Relationship between artist followers and top track popularity.\n>* Relationship between song duration and top track popularity.\n>* Relationship between artist popularity and top track popularity.\n\nAppreciate any comment and feedback,thanks!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import libraries for EDA & Data Viz\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport
